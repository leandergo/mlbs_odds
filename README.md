# Can you analytically find games to bet unders on?
## by Leander Goessling and Rohan Sekhar

Using data on odds for MLB games between 2012 and 2021, is it possible to predict which games will go under or over the run total?
Using K-nearest neighbors, we analyze how games with similar odds and run total predictions favored and so far found no strong relationships that would be profitable to bet on (need about 52.8% accuracy).
In the near future we will add more features to make the model more effective and possibly find profitable games to bet on.
